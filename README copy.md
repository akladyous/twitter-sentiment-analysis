##### Metrics

-   Accuracy
-   AUC

##### Liberary

-   Numpy
-   Pandas
-   Seaborn
-   Matplotlib
-   Tensorflow
-   Scikit-learn

#### Models

-   TfidfVectorizer
-   GloVe

##### Conclusion

TfidfVectorizer model are able to predicts 87% of AUC accuracy despite dealing with a highly unbalanced dataset where the classes "natural", "positive", "negative", "i can't tell" are respectively represented by 59.26%, 32.75% 6.27% and 1.72%. howevere tuning the neural network properly helped to avoid overfitting.
